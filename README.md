Babylon Redux: Prompt Engineering and Digital Literature

Babylon Redux explores the intersection of computational methods and literary creativity, reimagining Jorge Luis Borges’ The Library of Babel through interactive webtext experiments. Employing mixed methods of prompt engineering, the project draws from the Oulipo’s literary constraints and Johanna Drucker’s theories on stochastic poetics. The experiments demonstrate how literary frameworks and computational tools can create dynamic, engaging forms of digital writing that respond to user interaction.

Experimental Webtexts
	•	Mood Ring: A dynamic poem generator that restyles lines of verse based on cursor position, looping over nonlinear versions of a decade-old personal poem.
	•	Star Signal: Encodes The Library of Babel passages in Morse code, displayed in a Fibonacci spiral of animated stars.
	•	Tower Fragments: Selects and filters passages from The Library of Babel into philosophical, literary, or descriptive categories using a weighted probability distribution.
	•	Index Loop: A 26-word index of Borgesian terms interwoven with AI-generated neologisms, shifting alphabetically at the rhythm of a heartbeat.
	•	Cipher Text: Encrypts The Library of Babel using classical ciphers, displayed as interactive blocks containing a coded message from the future.

Quick Start
	1.	Open index.html in any modern browser.
	2.	Navigate between experiments via the floating menu.
	3.	Pure HTML/CSS/JS – no build process or dependencies required.

Technical Notes

The development process utilized several code-based LLMs to refine the webtext experiments. Each piece foregrounds prompt engineering’s potential to expand literary possibilities.
