# Babylon Redux
## Digital OULIPO and Prompt Engineering as Creative Writing

Grounded in methods of prompt engineering, Babylon Redux reimagines Jorge Luis Borges' *The Library of Babel* as a series of interactive webtext experiments. Each project employs a combination of literary and computational constraints to remix and reconfigure Borges' passages into new digital forms, drawing from OULIPO's playful rigor and Johanna Drucker's work on stochastic poetics to demonstrate how computational methods and literary frameworks can intersect to make creative writing more interactive, engaging, and adaptable to digital environments.

### Experimental Webtexts
- **Mood Ring**: A dynamic poem generator that selects and restyles lines of verse based on cursor position, looping over random nonlinear versions of a decade-old personal poem
- **Tower Fragments**: Select passages from *The Library of Babel*, classified as either philosophical, literary, or descriptive filtered through a weighted probability distribution
- **Star Signal**: Morse code blinking signals from *The Library of Babel* in a Fibonacci spiral set against the distant starlight of the Hubble Telescope
- **Infinite Index**: 26-word index of Borgesian terms and concepts interspersed with synthetic AI-generated neologisms that scramble alphabetically with cursor movement

### Quick Start
1. Open `home.html` in any modern browser
2. Navigate between experiments using the floating menu
3. Pure HTML/CSS/JS - no build process or dependencies needed
