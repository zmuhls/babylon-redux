# Babylon Redux
## Prompt Engineering Potential Literature
This website transforms Jorge Luis Borges’ Library of Babel into a collection of interactive webtexts spanning combinatorial tools, algorithmic cut-ups, and more. Each project combines literary and computational constraints to remix and reconfigure Borges' passages into new digital forms, bridging creative expression with algorithmic play. Inspired by the playful rigor of OULIPO and Johanna Drucker’s work on stochastic poetics, the project showcases how computational methods and literary frameworks intersect to make creative writing more interactive, engaging, and adaptable to digital environments.

## Experimental Webtexts

- **Mood Ring**: A dynamic poem generator that restyles lines of verse based on cursor position, looping over nonlinear versions of a decade-old personal poem. [Try it](https://zmuhls.github.io/babylon-redux/ring.html)
- **Star Signal**: Encodes The Library of Babel passages in Morse code, displayed in a Fibonacci spiral of animated stars. [Try it](https://zmuhls.github.io/babylon-redux/signal.html)
- **Tower Fragments**: Selects and filters passages from The Library of Babel into philosophical, literary, or descriptive categories using a weighted probability distribution. [Try it](https://zmuhls.github.io/babylon-redux/fragments.html)
- **Index Loop**: A 26-word index of Borgesian terms interwoven with AI-generated neologisms, shifting alphabetically at the rhythm of a heartbeat. [Try it](https://zmuhls.github.io/babylon-redux/loop.html)
- **Cipher Text**: Encrypts The Library of Babel using classical ciphers, displayed as interactive blocks containing a coded message from the future. [Try it](https://zmuhls.github.io/babylon-redux/cipher.html)

## Quick Start
1. Open index.html in any modern browser
2. Navigate between experiments via the floating menu
3. Pure HTML/CSS/JS – no build process or dependencies required

## Technical Notes

I used several code-based LLMs to generate and fine-tune these projects including ChatGPT-3.5/4o, Claude-3.5 Sonnet, and company. I would often generate first drafts in a chatbot conversation, then moved the code to Visual Code Studio to refine it by hand and with Colab versions of ChatGPT-4o.
